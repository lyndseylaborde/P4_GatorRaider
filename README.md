# P4_GatorRaider
COP3502 Project 4

This project focused on inheritance and polymorphism through programing logic for a computer to play “GatorRaider,” a spin-off of Mrs. PacMan. The code base was provided, and the task was to implement logic in StudentAttackerController.java that will allow the computer to achieve the highest score possible. 
*note, the images folder should be nested inside of exec, however there was an issue uploading a large file and I am in the process of figuring out how to edit the file tree within git hub. exec should include both images & data subfolders
